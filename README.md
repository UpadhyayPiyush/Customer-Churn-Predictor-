# Customer Churn Predictor 

## Project Overview 
This project focuses on analyzing telecom customer churn to understand why customers leave and how churn can be reduced using data-driven insights. 
The workflow combines MySQL, Power BI, and Python to deliver an end-to-end analytics and prediction solution. 
Customer data was cleaned and structured through an ETL pipeline, followed by in-depth churn analysis using SQL. 
An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to visualize churn trends, customer behavior, and revenue impact. 
Additionally, a Random Forest machine learning model was built to predict high-risk churn customers with 84% accuracy. 
The project helps businesses proactively identify churn risk and improve customer retention strategies.

## Business Problem & Objective 
Customer churn is a major challenge for telecom companies, leading to significant revenue loss and reduced customer lifetime value. With increasing competition, retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. However, identifying why customers churn and which customers are at risk is not always straightforward.
The objective of this project is to analyze customer behavior, identify key churn drivers, calculate churn metrics (27.4% churn rate), and build a predictive model to proactively detect high-risk churn customers, enabling data-driven retention strategies.
